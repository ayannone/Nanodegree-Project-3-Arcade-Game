Welcome to Arcade Game - Frogger
================================

Here are the rules:

- Select a player
- When you are ready "Start new game"
- You have 30 seconds to collect as many items as possible
- Collect a heart, star or key will give you 10 points each
- Collect a gem (blue, green or orange) will give you 30 points each (but be aware: they disappear after a while)
- Collect a meteor will give you 50 points (but be aware: once it starts sliding down its gone)
- Be careful with the bugs! Avoid colliding with them or you loose all you points!!
- If you make to the water line you will get 20 points and can continue collecting more items.. YEAH!!

GOOD LUCK!!
